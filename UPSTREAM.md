The vendored folders are that commit, unchanged. The lab runs Vulhub's published image `vulhub/aria2:1.18.8`, pinned by tag (as Vulhub's own compose file does); its Dockerfile is vendored under `base/` to show how it is built. Building from `base/` instead would download the vulnerable software from its original sources, some of which are gone.

To update, replace the vendored folders with a newer Vulhub commit, then change this file.
